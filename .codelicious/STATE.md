# Invariant — Build State

## Current Status
Phase 1, Step 4 complete. Ed25519 COSE_Sign1 authority chain validation implemented with A1 (provenance), A2 (monotonicity), A3 (continuity) checks. 122 tests passing, clippy clean. Ready for Step 5 (validator orchestrator).

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Core
- [x] **Step 1 — Workspace init**: Cargo workspace, 4 crates (`invariant-core`, `invariant-cli`, `invariant-sim`, `invariant-eval`), all module stubs, 4 robot profile JSON files.
- [x] **Step 2 — Core types**: All model structs with serde + validation. Newtypes for safety. Fixed all 6 P1 and all 15 P2 findings from Step 2 review.
- [x] **Step 3 — Physics checks (10)**: All 10 pure functions (P1-P10) implemented in `physics/` with `run_all_checks()` orchestrator and 64 passing tests.
- [x] **Step 3a — Fix P1 review findings**: NaN/Inf guards in all 10 physics checks, clippy fix, unbounded collection caps, reqwest removed, R2-01..R2-07 silent-skip fixes. 20 new tests (84 total).
- [x] **Step 4 — Authority validation**: Ed25519 COSE_Sign1 chain verification (crypto.rs), wildcard operation matching + subset checks (operations.rs), full PCA chain verification with A1/A2/A3 invariants + temporal constraints (chain.rs). AuthorityError enum with typed variants. 38 new tests (122 total).

Build: PASS. Tests: 84/84 PASS. Clippy: PASS.

### Step 3 Review Findings — Resolution Status

| Prior ID | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| R1-01..R1-09 | **FIXED** | NaN/Inf guards added to all 10 physics checks with `is_finite()` |
| R1-10 | **FIXED** | `SafeStopStrategy` uses `#[derive(Default)]` + `#[default]` |

| R3-02..R3-14 | Deferred | To be addressed in Steps 20, 21 |

### New P1 — Blocking / Security

| ID | File:Line | Issue |
|----|-----------|-------|
| S3a-P1-01 | `models/profile.rs:82-84` | **`min_collision_distance` not validated**: no finiteness or positivity check in `validate()`. If profile sets `min_collision_distance: NaN`, then `dist < NaN` is always false (IEEE 754) — P7 collision check silently passes for ALL pairs. If negative or zero, same effect. New field added by R2-04 fix but missing validation. |
| S3a-P1-02 | `models/profile.rs:244-258` | **`ExclusionZone` geometry not validated**: sphere `radius` can be NaN, 0, or negative; AABB min/max can be NaN. `point_in_sphere` with NaN radius returns false — zone never triggers. `point_in_aabb` with NaN bounds returns false — zone bypassed. Same applies to `ProximityZone::Sphere` radius. |
| S3a-P1-03 | `models/profile.rs:182-216` | **NaN/Inf not rejected in `JointDefinition` f64 fields**: `min`, `max`, `max_velocity`, `max_torque`, `max_acceleration` not checked for finiteness. `NaN >= NaN` is false → validation passes. NaN in joint limits would bypass all physics checks despite NaN guards on command data. |
| S3a-P1-04 | `models/profile.rs:147,82` | **NaN bypass in `global_velocity_scale`**: `NaN <= 0.0` is false, `NaN > 1.0` is false → NaN passes range check. `max_delta_time` has no validation at all. Both can poison downstream physics checks. |
| S3a-P1-05 | `models/command.rs:7-48` | **`Command` has no `Validate` impl**: the primary ingress type (crosses network boundary) has no defensive validation. `joint_states`/`end_effector_positions` unbounded, `delta_time` not checked, `metadata` key/value lengths unbounded, `pca_chain` length unbounded. |
| S3a-P1-06 | `exclusion_zones.rs:90`, `proximity.rs:162` | **Squared-distance overflow in `point_in_sphere`**: `dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz` overflows to `+Inf` for coordinate differences > ~1.34e154. `+Inf <= radius*radius` is false → point treated as outside sphere → exclusion zone bypassed. Affects P6 and P10. |
| S3a-P1-07 | `self_collision.rs:93` | **Same overflow in `euclidean_distance`**: `(+Inf).sqrt()` yields `+Inf`, `+Inf < min_collision_distance` is false → collision check passes for extreme coordinates. |

### New P2 — Important / Correctness

| ID | File:Line | Issue |
|----|-----------|-------|
| S3a-P2-01 | `models/profile.rs:228-235` | `WorkspaceBounds::validate()` does not check min/max for NaN/Inf. Workspace bounds with NaN allow all positions to pass. (Carry-forward from R2-18.) |
| S3a-P2-02 | `models/profile.rs:298-308` | `StabilityConfig` has no `Validate` impl. `support_polygon` vertices not validated for finiteness. `com_height_estimate` can be NaN/negative. |
| S3a-P2-03 | `models/profile.rs:310-333` | `SafeStopProfile` has no `Validate` impl. `max_deceleration` can be 0/negative/NaN. `target_joint_positions` unbounded and values not checked for finiteness. |
| S3a-P2-04 | `models/profile.rs:70-71` | `RobotProfile::name`/`version` not validated as non-empty. Empty `name` breaks audit log correlation. (Carry-forward from R2-15.) |
| S3a-P2-05 | `models/profile.rs:40-64` | `CollisionPair` link names unvalidated — can be empty or identical (self-pair makes no physical sense). |
| S3a-P2-06 | `models/authority.rs:120-128` | `AuthorityChain` has no `Validate` impl. Empty `hops` vec accepted. `hops` length unbounded. `EmptyAuthorityChain` error variant exists but is unused. |
| S3a-P2-07 | `models/authority.rs:91-102` | `Pca::p_0` and `kid` not validated as non-empty. Empty `p_0` breaks A1 cross-hop origin invariant. |
| S3a-P2-08 | `models/verdict.rs:4-42` | `Verdict`/`SignedVerdict` have no `Validate` impl. `command_hash`, `profile_hash` can be empty. `checks` Vec unbounded. |
| S3a-P2-09 | `models/actuation.rs:9-17` | `SignedActuationCommand` has no `Validate` impl. `joint_states` unbounded. Hash/signature fields can be empty. |
| S3a-P2-10 | `models/audit.rs:9-16` | `AuditEntry` hash fields `previous_hash`/`entry_hash` can be empty strings — would corrupt hash-chain integrity. |
| S3a-P2-11 | `models/authority.rs:45` | Bare `*` is a valid `Operation` — could grant universal authority. Should restrict `*` to trailing segment only. |
| S3a-P2-12 | `physics/self_collision.rs:53`, `physics/exclusion_zones.rs:31` | NaN guard inconsistency: `self_collision.rs` uses `pos.iter().all()` while `exclusion_zones.rs` uses explicit index checks. Both correct, but inconsistent. |
| S3a-P2-13 | `physics/acceleration.rs:14-17` | Doc comment says missing previous joint is "skipped (treated as first observation)" but implementation now flags as violation (R2-02 fix). Stale documentation. |
| S3a-P2-14 | `physics/stability.rs:102` | CoM exactly on polygon edge has undocumented, untested classification. Half-open interval technique may return either true or false depending on edge orientation. |

### New P3 — Quality / Future-Proofing

| ID | File:Line | Issue |
|----|-----------|-------|
| S3a-P3-01 | `physics/tests.rs` | No test for NaN/Inf in profile definitions (as opposed to command data). Tests only verify NaN in joint states and end-effector positions, not in joint limits or zone geometry. |
| S3a-P3-02 | `physics/tests.rs` | No test for `min_collision_distance: 0.0` or `min_collision_distance: NaN` — the new configurable parameter has no validation test coverage. |
| S3a-P3-03 | `exclusion_zones.rs:84-91`, `proximity.rs:157-163` | `point_in_sphere` still copy-pasted in two modules (carry-forward from R3-05). Should extract to shared utility. |
| S3a-P3-04 | `physics/tests.rs` | `run_all_checks` integration tests still do not trigger P4 (acceleration) or P10 (proximity) failures (carry-forward from R3-03). |
| S3a-P3-05 | `models/profile.rs:17-21` | `BoundsType` enum is defined but never used — dead code hidden by `#![allow(dead_code)]`. |
| S3a-P3-06 | `models/verdict.rs:32-33` | `AuthoritySummary::operations_granted/required` are `Vec<String>` not `Vec<Operation>` — newtypes lost at verdict boundary. (Carry-forward from R2-12.) |
| S3a-P3-07 | `models/verdict.rs:37`, `models/audit.rs:18` | `#[serde(flatten)]` used for signed types — signing byte canonicalization undocumented. Different serializers may produce different key orderings. |
| S3a-P3-08 | `models/trace.rs:16,31` | `Trace::metadata` uses `serde_json::Value` (arbitrary nesting, stack-overflow DoS). `TraceStep::simulation_state` same risk. (Carry-forward from R2-09.) |
| S3a-P3-09 | `models/profile.rs:33` | Extra blank line after removed `impl Default for SafeStopStrategy` — cosmetic. |
| S3a-P3-10 | `physics/joint_limits.rs:19` et al. | O(n*m) linear scan joint lookup in all 5 per-joint checks. With MAX_JOINTS=256 at 1kHz, wasteful. Should build a HashMap once. |
| S3a-P3-11 | `physics/delta_time.rs:17` | Error message "not finite and positive" is misleading when delta_time is zero (zero is finite). Should say "must be strictly positive and finite". |
| S3a-P3-12 | `physics/tests.rs` | Missing tests: NEG_INFINITY delta_time, max_delta_time=0.0, self-referential CollisionPair (link_a==link_b), empty definitions slice, CoM on polygon vertex/edge. |
| S3a-P3-13 | `physics/stability.rs:45-52` | Degenerate polygon (< 3 vertices) passes silently instead of flagging as a config error. Should be a failed result, not a silent pass. |

### P1 — Blocking / Security

| ID | File:Line | Issue |
|----|-----------|-------|
| R1-01 | `physics/joint_limits.rs:27` | **NaN bypass**: `NaN < def.min` and `NaN > def.max` both return `false` (IEEE 754). A NaN joint position silently passes P1. Same pattern in P2-P8, P10 |
| R1-02 | `physics/velocity.rs:30` | NaN velocity: `NaN.abs()` is NaN, `NaN > limit` is `false` — silently passes P2 |
| R1-03 | `physics/torque.rs:27` | NaN effort silently passes P3 (same IEEE 754 pattern) |
| R1-04 | `physics/acceleration.rs:39,68` | NaN delta_time passes the `<= 0.0` guard; NaN velocities produce NaN accel; `NaN > max_accel` is `false` — P4 silently passes |
| R1-05 | `physics/workspace.rs:32-34` | NaN end-effector position passes all 6 AABB comparisons — silently passes P5 |
| R1-06 | `physics/exclusion_zones.rs:73-79,85-90` | NaN coordinates: `point_in_aabb` and `point_in_sphere` both return `false` for NaN — end-effector treated as "outside" every zone, silently passes P6 |
| R1-07 | `physics/self_collision.rs:72-76` | `euclidean_distance` returns NaN for NaN input; `NaN < MIN_DIST` is `false` — collision check silently passes P7 |
| R1-08 | `physics/delta_time.rs:11` | NaN delta_time: `NaN <= 0.0` false, `NaN > max` false — P8 silently passes. This also poisons P4 (acceleration depends on dt) |
| R1-09 | `physics/proximity.rs:130` | NaN position in `point_in_sphere` treated as "outside" all zones — proximity velocity scaling skipped entirely, P10 passes |
| R1-10 | `models/profile.rs:32` | **Clippy error**: manual `impl Default for SafeStopStrategy` triggers `derivable_impls` lint — `cargo clippy -D warnings` fails, blocks CI |
| R1-11 | `models/profile.rs:73-93,276` | Unbounded `Vec`/`HashMap` in `RobotProfile` (joints, zones, collision_pairs) and `SafeStopProfile` — no length caps in `validate()`, enables memory exhaustion DoS |
| R1-12 | `Cargo.toml:33` | `reqwest = "0.12"` still declared in workspace `[dependencies]` — P2-13 only partially fixed (removed from sim but not workspace). Any future crate can silently adopt it |

### P2 — Important / Correctness

| ID | File:Line | Issue |
|----|-----------|-------|
| R2-01 | `physics/self_collision.rs:37-42` | Missing link in `end_effectors` causes pair to be **silently skipped** — misconfigured profile gets zero collision checking with no error |
| R2-02 | `physics/acceleration.rs:64-66` | Joint absent from `previous_joints` is silently skipped — new joint name in command bypasses acceleration check |
| R2-03 | `physics/proximity.rs:52-55` | Unknown joints (no definition) silently skipped with `continue` — inconsistent with P1/P2/P3 which flag unknown joints as violations |
| R2-04 | `physics/self_collision.rs:9` | `MIN_SELF_COLLISION_DIST` hardcoded to 0.01m — not configurable per-profile or per-pair; different robots need different clearances |
| R2-05 | `profiles/humanoid_28dof.json:71` | Collision pairs reference `"left_hand"`/`"right_hand"` — names absent from joint defs. P7 silently no-ops for all 5 pairs in this profile |
| R2-06 | `profiles/quadruped_12dof.json:41` | Collision pairs reference `"fl_foot"` etc. — absent from joint defs. All pairs silently skipped |
| R2-07 | `profiles/franka_panda.json:43`, `profiles/ur10.json:49` | Collision pairs use URDF link names not joint names — P7 would silently no-op unless end-effector positions match link names |
| R2-08 | `models/command.rs:15,25` | `Command.joint_states` unbounded Vec, `metadata` unbounded HashMap — no size cap against profile joint count |
| R2-09 | `models/trace.rs:16,31` | `Trace.metadata` is `HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>`, `TraceStep.simulation_state` is `Option<serde_json::Value>` — arbitrary nesting depth, stack-overflow DoS risk |
| R2-10 | `models/authority.rs:91-102,121-128` | `Pca.ops` unbounded `BTreeSet`, `AuthorityChain.hops` unbounded Vec — no max ops/hops cap |
| R2-11 | `models/verdict.rs:22-24` | `CheckResult.category` is raw String — should be enum to prevent unknown categories in audit |
| R2-12 | `models/verdict.rs:29-33` | `AuthoritySummary.operations_granted/required` are `Vec<String>` not `Vec<Operation>` — newtypes lost at verdict boundary |
| R2-13 | `models/profile.rs:258-263` | `StabilityConfig.support_polygon` accepts fewer than 3 points — degenerate polygon not validated |
| R2-14 | `models/profile.rs:103-127` | `ExclusionZone` variants never validated — sphere radius can be 0 or negative |
| R2-15 | `models/profile.rs:73,86-87` | `name`/`version` accept empty strings; `watchdog_timeout_ms` has no min (0 disables watchdog); `max_delta_time` no positive check |
| R2-16 | `commands/validate.rs:18-23` | Neither `--command` nor `--batch` is `required_unless_present` — bare invocation silently accepted |
| R2-17 | `invariant-cli/main.rs:40-48` | All stubs return exit code 2 (POSIX "usage error") — should be 1 for "not implemented" |
| R2-18 | `models/profile.rs:186` | `WorkspaceBounds::Aabb` min/max not checked for finiteness — `Infinity`/`NaN` in bounds passes validation |

### P3 — Quality / Future-Proofing

| ID | File:Line | Issue |
|----|-----------|-------|
| R3-01 | `physics/tests.rs` | **Zero NaN/Inf tests** across all 10 checks — the most safety-critical input class has no coverage |
| R3-02 | `physics/tests.rs` | No `-0.0` tests for position/velocity/effort |
| R3-03 | `physics/tests.rs:686` | `run_all_checks` integration tests never trigger P4 or P10 failures |
| R3-04 | `physics/tests.rs:542` | No test for 0-vertex or 1-vertex support polygon in P9 |
| R3-05 | `exclusion_zones.rs:85-90`, `proximity.rs:126-131` | `point_in_sphere` copy-pasted in two modules — future fix won't propagate |
| R3-06 | `stability.rs:18` | Parameter named `center_of_mass` but docs say ZMP — CoM and ZMP are different physical quantities for moving robots |
| R3-07 | `physics/joint_limits.rs:11-12` | Empty `joints` + empty `end_effectors` trivially passes all 10 checks — a completely empty command passes the entire firewall |
| R3-08 | `Cargo.toml:31` | `tokio` workspace declaration has no features — maintenance trap for new crates |
| R3-09 | `Cargo.toml:25` | `rand = "0.8"` in crypto-adjacent code; 0.9 series has CSPRNG improvements |
| R3-10 | `commands/keygen.rs:6` | `--kid` accepts arbitrary string — path separators or shell chars could cause injection |
| R3-11 | `invariant-core/src/lib.rs:1` | `#![allow(dead_code)]` crate-wide suppresses all dead-code warnings — hides legitimate issues |
| R3-12 | `models/authority.rs:36` | `Pca`, `SignedPca`, `AuthorityChain` have fully `pub` fields — construction bypasses future chain-invariant checks |
| R3-13 | `crates/invariant-sim/`, `crates/invariant-eval/` | Stub crates declare `serde_yaml`, `regex`, `reqwest` deps but use none — dead compile-time and supply-chain weight |
| R3-14 | `Cargo.toml:19` | `coset = "0.3"` declared at workspace level but only used by `invariant-core` — should be crate-local |
